# Type selection

During the video you hear a conversation between two main voices. The first voice you hear is that from a system or person who instructs the other voice. The other voice belongs to the main character.

## Voice 1

This voice probably belongs to a system that has a human-like quality. It starts fairly neutral but comes across more and more aggressively as the video clip goes on. Especially in the scene where the main character is interrogated. It's when this system picks up the pace and calls out those two words: "cells" and "interlinked".

### Characteristics

- In control
- Aggressive
- Daunting

At first this voice was displayed in a mono typeface. This typeface was picked because of the sci-fi themes which occur in the movie.

However the visual traits of this type category felt misplaced during the interrogation scene.

Here is a comparison of these type categories compared.

The serif category has a much stronger impact. Even in thicker font-weights. The lack of serif makes the typeface feel too clean for this threatening/daunting feeling that is expressed. There is something about the hook-like features which make it seem more dangerous.

> The feedback from Marie was very positive about this choice of type. I was curious about if it might come across too strong. When I addressed this issue said that she liked it like this because it is visually interesting and stands out from the rest.

Marie also mentioned that if various typefaces are being used it can come across as if it's being spoken by multiple people. Which is why the serif type is adopted for each instance where the first voice is spoken.

## Voice 2

The second voice is that of the main character. The main character has a stoic way of speaking in the video presented. There is a lack of emotion, not that of anger, nor happiness. This voice is therefore displayed in a sans-serif typeface. A more neutral typeface selection for the modern age.

The visual properties of this vary in small ways. For example in his first part of the dialogue he recites his baseline. He does this in a narrative-like manner. This is depicted in a subtle italic version of the typeface.

# Type placement

Something that often bothers me when watching movies with subtitles is the placement. Placing the closed captions at the bottom makes the entire experience less immersive. The text is fighting the visuals for attention. Your eyes are guided from visual to bottom for each time a sound plays (which is a lot).

Having those experiences in the back in mind, I started experimenting. If the visuals were fairly minimal, the text is placed in the center. If there is a visually important on screen, it gets priority. An example of this can be seen above. The main character is on the screen which makes way for the type. It creates a horizontal composition that makes us focus first on the character, then our eyes are guided to the text.

These show small a small increment in position and scale. A subtle difference to communicate the repeating of the same dialogue.

# The Transition

The whole first part of the video is happening in the interrogation room. It's here that the dialogue concurs, but this isn't made clear from the beginning.

To capitalize on this, the video is presented in a frame from the start. Behind the video you see a blurred video to add ambient effects. The thought behind it is to show that there is something more going on behind the video itself.

The to transition to the actual conversation we are greeted with a full-screen view. Making the scene feel more intimate than the more distant conversation before.

# Background sound

There are three main sound effects in this video

- 1 Subtle background sounds
- 2 Loud alarm(ing) sound
- 3 A high pitched noise which creeps up

## Subtle background sounds

These type of sounds are subtle and add a lot of ambiances. They make the scene feel larger than what we see. One of these sounds is a siren. It sounds like it could be from a police car. The visual that was used for this resemebles that. A blue moving light, bleeding subtly into the video.

## Loud and intimidating alarms

Then there are some load and mechanical sounding alarms. These are aggressive and sound dangerous. It sounds like it could be from prison, like a place you don't want to be in. Since the sound is so large, the effect is placed over the entire screen. Giving it a strong and intimidating feeling.

## The creeping high pitched sound

Finally, there is this noise which adds a lot of tension. In design you can create tension by placing elements close to an edge. The lack of space makes us uncomfortable. With this in mind we can implement a similar effect by shrinking the video over time. The longer you watch, the less space you have.

The sound itself starts of unnoticeable and gets louder and louder. This easing of sound is also applied to the animation curve. This is done by a slow ease-in and fast ease-out. Making the video shrink very slow, slow, normal, faster, and you hopefully get nervous by this point.

# Use of color

The main goal of this assignment to me is to accompany the video with contextual effects and a more meaningful type. There are parts I wanted to highlight and make you feel something. For this to happen there needed to be a strong neutral tone with sporadic moments that captivate the attention. This is done by using a minimal color palette. The type is often displayed with pure white. Then the color red is used to highlight those parts which need to stand out. The parts which stand out are aggressive and intimidating. Which is why the color red is chosen.

# Exclusive design

## Study situation

To understand the movie one needs to watch it without sound. One then realizes how boring it is. This makes you realize that the added sound effect builds a great deal of tension and pressure.

When you start looking at how other movies use captions to achieve this effect, you realize that most don't. Only a select few got creative with their captions. This makes the situation like a blank canvas. It meant I needed to do experiments on my own and start exploring.

## Ignore conventions

There aren't that many conventions when it comes to closed captions. We are familiar with the centered text at the bottom of the screen. Which is a convention that I'm not a fan of. It causes the expercience to be less immersive. You are constantly moving your eyes from bottom to center. Trying to do two things at the same time. This positioning is the first convention I broke.

## Prioritise identity

I tried to get the most out of time with Marie. Asking questions I thought I knew the answer to. Sometimes I got the expected answer, other times she presented a new insight. For example I added emoticons to the sound effects to make them more scannable. However she found it distracting from the text. So those were removed. Other things she liked like the big red text. It's something others thought were a bit extreme, but Marie liked it. So a bit less extreme version of that stayed in. Here I prioritized the identity of Marie over convention.

## Add Nonsense

There has been a lot of nonsense in this project. Every change started as nonsense. The most nonsense-like thing that was changed, was removing the entire video for a moment. Only leaving the user with a blurry background to look at. The goal was to confuse the watcher. It did confuse the watcher. Turned out that Marie doesn't like to be confused. It looked something went wrong, which wasn't the goal. So we had to smooth that out.

# Feedback

The goal for the feedback to push boundaries and see what would stick. For example like what I described above at "Add Nonsense". I removed the entire video at some point. The text was at some point larger than the screen itself. This helped to explore new concepts and get a grasp of what Marie and Vasilis value.

## Feedback Vasilis #1

- Cool effects, like that you experimented
- Some effects are quite extreme, test this with Marie
- The timing of the video does not match the background video (maybe you are doing too much)

## Feedback Marie #1

- The effects add a lot and are intense, good that you experimented
- However, it is not always clear what the sounds are that are being visualized, add a description as closed caption
- It is not always clear who says what, make more distinction here

## What I did

- [x] Match the video with the background
- [x] Update the javascript which made it easier to work within CSS.
- [x] Added closed captions
- [x] Reduced some effects

Here you see how I updated the Javascript. Every time a sound effect is played, it's also removed. This helps a lot with closed captions and effects. Now you don't have to time it yourself with keyframes.

Also who is speaking and when is added to the body. This helps with certain styling of elements. CSS works from top to bottom. Meaning you can style a `p` in a `body`, but not a `body` outside of a `p`.

## Feedback Vasilis #2

- The experiments are still fun, but some come across as accidental
- This is, for example, when you transition in the last scene

## Feedback Marie #2

- The red text is intensive and aggressive. It stands out and is unique.
- If you style the text in different ways, it may look like someone else says it.
- The sound effects are now also described as a closed caption.
  - These are too far down on larger screens
  - The emoji distracts from the text
- There were a lot of experiments during the transition to the last scene
  - It was too experimental and not clear enough
  - With those kinds of sounds, it seems like something is going wrong in the browser

## What I did

- [x] Stop using emoticons in the captions
- [x] Position the closed captions relative to the video
- [x] Make the transition to the last scene more clearly by not removing the video
      [x] Make the text more uniform with the other text of voice1
- [x] Better description of the sound, especially about the intensity
